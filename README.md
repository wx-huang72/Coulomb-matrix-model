# Coulomb-matrix-model

A model to calculate Coulomb matrix for water. If there are Na atoms in the molecule we define a matrix X, whose
element Xij is given by,

where Rij is the distance between the ith and jth atom in the molecule, and Zi and Zj are nuclear charges.

Given the water molecule shown below, calculate the Coulomb matrix for this molecule, with Zi = 1 for hydrogen atoms and
Zi = 8 for oxygen.
